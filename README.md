# Seedship translator
> By CptHenri#0001

#### Nota bene:
Yeah the UI is in French, feel free to fork the repo but I won't add locations and stuff.
This tool is very specific, I only spent a day on the code, don't expect it to be beautiful ðŸ˜…

Anyways, enjoy!

Retrieve the array you need to translate, it looks like this:
`const array = ["first element", "second element", "etc."]`
Make sure the last element doesn't have a comma, you'll get an error otherwise.

The script will use an UNOFFICIAL API wrapper (reverso.net), I've been told you might get IP banned from the website if they detect heavy traffic or something...
**Feel free to make a PR if you found an another API** (not too limited and free ofc)
